            >The world's oceans are vital to life on Earth, covering over 70% of
            the planet's surface and providing essential resources for humans
            and wildlife. However, the health of our marine ecosystems is under
            threat due to various human activities. Sustainable Development Goal
            14: Life Below Water aims to conserve and sustainably use the
            oceans, seas, and marine resources. Unfortunately, several critical
            problems are jeopardizing the well-being of these vital

              <h4><u>Description : </u></h4>
              <p>
                Overfishing occurs when fish and other marine species are caught
                at a faster rate than they can reproduce. This leads to a severe
                depletion of fish populations, threatening the balance of marine
                ecosystems and the survival of species.
              </p>
              <h4><u>Causes:</u></h4>
              <p>
                <li>

                  growth and dietary preferences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Advanced Fishing Technology: Improved fishing technology leads
                  to more efficient but unsustainable fishing practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lack of Regulation: Inadequate or poorly enforced fishing
                  regulations and quotas.

              <p>
                Climate change leads to rising ocean temperatures, sea level
                rise, and increased CO2 levels, causing ocean acidification.

                Bycatch refers to the unintentional capture of non-target

          <h2><b>Overfishing</b></h2>
          <p>
            <li>
              Short-term: Initial depletion of target fish species, leading to
              reduced catches and economic losses for fishing communities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Medium-term: Disruption of food webs as predator-prey
              relationships are altered, causing imbalances in marine
              ecosystems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term: Collapse of fish populations, loss of biodiversity, and
              the potential extinction of species, leading to ecosystem
              degradation and loss of ecosystem services
            </li>
          </p>
          <h2><b>Pollution</b></h2>
          <p>
            <li>
              Short-term: Immediate harm to marine organisms through ingestion
              or entanglement in plastics, exposure to toxic substances, and
              degradation of water quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Medium-term: Accumulation of pollutants in the food chain, leading
              to health issues in marine life and humans who consume seafood.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term: Persistent pollutants, such as microplastics and heavy
              metals, remain in the environment for decades, causing chronic
              health problems for marine organisms and altering ecosystem
              functions.
            </li>
          </p>
          <h2><b>Climate Change</b></h2>
          <p>
            <li>
              Short-term: Increased water temperatures and ocean acidification
              stress marine species, leading to coral bleaching and shifts in
              species distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Medium-term: More frequent and severe storms, sea level rise, and
              changes in ocean currents disrupt habitats and migration patterns,
              affecting the survival of marine species.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term: Fundamental changes in marine ecosystems, including the
              loss of coral reefs, altered species composition, and reduced
              biodiversity, compromising the ocean’s ability to support life and
              human livelihoods.
            </li>
          </p>
          <h2><b>Habitat Destruction</b></h2>
          <p>
            <li>
              Short-term: Direct loss of critical habitats such as coral reefs,
              mangroves, and seagrass beds due to coastal development, trawling,
              and other destructive practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Medium-term: Reduced habitat availability leads to declining
              populations of species that rely on these environments for
              breeding, feeding, and shelter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term: Irreversible loss of habitats results in the permanent
              decline of marine biodiversity, weakening ecosystem resilience and
              reducing the capacity of marine environments to recover from
              disturbances.
            </li>
          </p>
          <h2><b>Bycatch and Illegal Fishing</b></h2>
          <p>
            <li>
              Short-term: Immediate mortality of non-target species, including
              endangered and juvenile fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and
              turtles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Medium-term: Decreased populations of bycatch species, disrupting
              marine food webs and ecological balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term: Endangered species face an increased risk of
              extinction, leading to the loss of keystone species and long-term
              impacts on ecosystem structure and function.
